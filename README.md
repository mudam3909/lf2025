## ü§ñ Overview

Welcome to the **Kubernetes Expert Session: Building and Deploying Apps with Kubernetes 2025**. This hands-on workshop will guide you through containerizing an application and running it on Kubernetes. You will learn how to deploy a simple application and test its resilience by injecting chaos into it. We will also have some fun games at the end where we‚Äôll try to "kill" our application to see how resilient it truly is.
